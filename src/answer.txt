CompSci IB Practice: Sales

10a.)
    The difference between a class and an instantiation of a class is that an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object,
    existing usually during the runtime of a computer program, whereas classes are templates that are used to create objects,
     and to define object data types and methods.

10b.)
    Two ways the principals of inheritance can be incorporated into the design of this administrative program is by using the extend
    function when creating GUIs that have the similar designs. An overreaching class that states these similar designs can have separate
    classes that extend from it yet contain different specifics.
10c.)
    The use of libraries can facilitate the development of programs like this company's administration program by separating objects
     based on things like authors name or genre. These overreaching sections contain subsections that can help navigate how and where
      to find a book.
11b.)
    The accessor methods are necessary for the SalesPerson class because there are variables that need to be manipulated by the user.
11ci.)
    (on a piece of paper)
11cii.)
    A negative effect that future changes in the design of the Sales object might have on this suite of programs is that it can only
    hold the price of one item at a time.
11d.)
    The output after running this code would be 102, 0, 2550.40, 1300.00
11h.)
    Changes that must be made to the SalesPerson class to allow these calculations to be made are an object that identifies
     what that Sales Person's salary is.
11i.)
    The use of polymorphism that occurs in this suite of programs are in the SalesPerson class.
